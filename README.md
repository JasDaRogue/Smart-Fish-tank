# Smart-Fish-tank 
This was a project for my subject "Embedded Systems" 

FEATURES:

• Automatically replaces the water of the fishtank on a set time and day. It uses a pump inside the fish tank to pump out water to a water tank and another inside a water reservoir to fill up the fish tank with new water.

• The system automatically adds water if the proper water level is not met.

• The prototype has an LCD screen that shows the water level of the fish tank and the time and date.

• There are notifications via text message for when the system is replacing the water and if the water tank for the old water is full.


MAIN COMPONENTS:

• Arduino Uno

• SIM800V2 5V WIRELESS GSM GRPS MODULE

• Relay
